# Quiz-game

In this project, I made a timed quiz using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. In this quiz, you are given 50 seconds to answer five questions consisting of multiple choice. You are given points for
every right answer you choose and penalized for answering a question wrong. This project consisted of two pages: the main page for the questions and the highscore page for keeping track of the highest scores stored in the application.
